# openshift-rampup

Exercise 0:
Read about and install the latest version of podman: https://podman.io/
Work through the getting started page. You can skip the checkpoint-migrate steps

Exercise 1:
(Use https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/ as reference)
Write a go program, which prints "Hello OpenShift" to stdout
Create a dockerfile which uses the latest golang image as a base image. The dockerfile should ensure the following happens:
- The .go file from the previous step is copied into the container
- The source is compiled into a binary
- The binary is set as the entrypoint of the container
Build a container image from the dockerfile with podman
Run the container image with podman
View the logs from the container run with podman

Exercise 2:
(Use https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/ as reference)
Do the above, but with a multi-stage build, copying the compiled binary to a second stage with ubi8 as a base image and running the executable there.

Exercise 3:
(Use https://docs.quay.io/solution/getting-started.html as reference)
Go to quay and click sign in on the top right of the page. Click sign in with google, and log in with your Red Hat google account. This will create a quay account for you.
Go to settings and create a CLI password.
In your terminal run `podman login quay.io`
Complete the login process using your new CLI password
Push the image you created in exercise 2 to quay
